### 1. Neighbourhood of an Image Pixel.

In order to have a fundamental knowledge about operations of image processing we must have the knowledge of neighbourhood of a pixel.

The above images show the two types of neighbourhood there exists. The centre pixel is the **Pixel of Interest (x,y)** in both cases. The first image (a) of the above figures shows **N-Four Neighbours**, and the second image (b) of the figures show **N-Eight Neighbours** respectvely. It also shows how they are referred with respect to the pixel of interests as  (x+n,y+n), n being 0 or 1 based on the adjacency of the neighbour from the POI
