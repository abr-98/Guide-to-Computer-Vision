### The RCNN Family

The RCNN family consists of 4 algorithms, namely: RCNN, Fast RCNN, Faster RCNN, and Mask RCNN. They are classifiction based 2 step object detection processes. 

RCNN families has some dependencies like Selective Search Algorithm in RCNN and Fast RCNN and Region Proposal Algorithm for Faster RCNN and Mask RCNN. The dependencies are seperately discussed.
