### YOLO (You Only Look Once)

As the name suggests, YOLO algorithm is an one stage algorithm, devised for fast and robust object detection. Unlike the R-CNN family they do not work on selected areas areas or target regions proposed by region proposal networks and select search methods. These algorithms are detect objects all over the image, which is faster and simpler but drags down performances.
