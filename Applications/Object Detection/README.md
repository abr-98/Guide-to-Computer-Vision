### Object Detection

It is one of the major tasks in the computer vision domain. Till now we have done image classification, that is we have answered the question, **"what is the image?"**. Then we started looking at the question **"Where is the object in the image?"**, through image localization concepts. Object detection problem attempts to answer both the questions **where** and **what** together, i.e, both localization and classification. Now, in classification, we can have only one object in the image. There can be multiple objects in the image in case of object detection algorithms. For every object present in the image, we need to find where the object is present and what the object is.
