### Image Classification

Image Classification is one of the fundamental tasks of computer vision. In these types of tasks, the computer is expected to provide a label to images. The task is the most basic challenges in the computer vision field. 

Image Classification task typically needs a fine-grained feature extraction, and a much larger global context, to generate the features. The task can be solved by both traditional Machine Learning algorithms or Black Box deep learning algorithms. 

For ML algorithms like KNN, SVM and ensemble based learrning, we need to use the traditional Image feature Extractors we talked about in the Feature Extraction portion,

Currently, in most cases, Deep Learning networks are used, owing to the fact that they extract the best features automatically and set their filters accordingly. 

In order to use DNN for Image classification, we can either build a custom modelling or can use any of the discussed pretrained models discussed using transfer learning. 

We can also use deep feature exrtractors like Feature Pyramid Networks and tune the model according to the task at hand to obtain good features and thus improve the predictive results.
