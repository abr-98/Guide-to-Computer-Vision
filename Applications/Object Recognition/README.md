### Object Recognition

This field in image processing deals with detecting what type of objects are present in an image, and find them in the image. Basically people end up getting cofused about Object Recognition, Object Detection, Object Classification and Object Localization. 

Object localization is the task of locating the object in an image using a bounding box.
Object Classification is the task of finding or predicting what type of object it is.
Object Detection is the combined task of Object classification and Object Localization,

All these three tasks are termed as Object Recognition together. The Object Recognition algorithm mainly include:

1. RCNN family
2. YOLO family
