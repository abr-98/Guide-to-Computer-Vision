### Path Aggregation Network (PANet)

PANet was first proposed by The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Peking University, SenseTime Research, and YouTu Lab, Tencent through the paper "Path Aggregation Network for Instance Segmentation". PANet has been used in several areas like in YOLO v4 for object detection. The authors introduced three chief ideas:

1. Bottom-up path augmentation for shortening the information path between the lower and higher feature map layers.
2. Adaptive feature pooling to obtain the best features after pooling from any feature level
3. Fully connected fusion layer to train the model parameters and get the spatial information in a better way at the same time to improve the mask prediction.
