### VGG Network

VGG16 is a convolutional neural network model proposed by K. Simonyan and A. Zisserman from the University of Oxford. It was one of the famous model submitted to ILSVRC-2014. The architecture was put forward in a paper titled "Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Image Recognition‚Äù. The model is trained on the Imagenet dataset. 

The paper proposes, several variants of the main stem architecture, namely, VGG-11, VGG-16, VGG-19, and compares thier relative performances. The VGG architecture modified the architecture by replacing large-sized kernel in AlexNet, with multiple 3x3 sized kernels in a repetative manner creating blocks, everytime increasing the number of filters.
